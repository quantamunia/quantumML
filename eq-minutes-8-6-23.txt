MINUTES OF MEETINGS  - 6 JUNE 2023
Keep things as simple as possible and concentrate on basic concepts of quantum machine learning
Remember the spaghetti challenge.  Something simple that we can build on
Identify learning resources we can use (learn first, then implement or learn as we proceed)
Keep it simple even as pertains to deployment on Azure
Next show and tell :  Talk about basics of Quantum Machine Learning
Highlight differences in QML & TML.
Whats the equivalent ML vs QML.
Put a structure , keep track of time and remained focused.
Justify your choices of the Quantum machine algorithms, metrics
Evaluation is the major aspect of this project.  Look at different approaches for evaluation.

ACTIONS ADOPTED:
- Agreed to test the Variational quantum classifier using the iris dataset.
- Agreed to upload our findings on google colab and discuss our different approaches on Thursday at 5:30pm via zoom.
