The classical counterpart of VQC (Variational Quantum Classifier) is a  variational classifier based on classical neural network architectures such as MLP.  Therefore it makes sense to compare MLP classifier with VQC.

VQC Constructs a quantum circuit and corresponding neural network, then uses it to instantiate a neural network classifier.  In this example we compare VQC and MLP on iris dataset.
