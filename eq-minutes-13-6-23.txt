MINUTES OF MEETINGS - 13 JUNE 2023
Lecturer noted that in the next show and tell we should highlight :
The advantages or disadvantages of quantum machine learning.
State reasons why we are using simple datasets.
Much more clarity and detail of quantum  concepts.
Who are our target users.
Also Simon reminded the team that converting histogram results from Azure to proper metrics such as F1, accuracy etc is the most difficult part.
Again...keep things simple.
